# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Rustlings course provided by the Rust team

**Thoughts:** It was OK, I managed to work through about 4 sections of the course today, but it was on topics I already knew fairly well. The later sections will be much harder I think!

### Day 2: March 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I started working on a timer/alarm project in Rust today. Took a break from the Rustlings course as I think I will need to read & take notes from 'The Book' before I can continue further.

**Thoughts**: It was pretty fun working through the different date & time crates. I was a bit disappointed with the crates available to play an MP3 player. They seem really heavy when all I want is to play an MP3 file. I'll put it down to my ignorance on how audio is processed.

### Day 3: March 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on making the alarm program into an executable and then running it through the terminal on MacOS. Added in some additional lines to make it wait 15 minutes and ding. I want it to appear at the top/front of my screen when it ends, but don't know how to do that.

**Thoughts**: Today was one of those days where I don't feel like I achieved as much as I would have liked. It was a really valuable session today, I mean I didn't even know how to open an executable on MacOS until today, so that's good!

### Day 4:

**Today's Progress**: Tackled the Rustlings course today and made my way through structs, modules, enums & collections.

**Thoughts**: I wasn't feeling it today so this was a struggle. A bit too tired to really throw myself fully at the alarm project especially as I know I need to deal with a Mac Window Manager of some sort.

### Day 5:

**Today's Progress**: Error handling was pretty interesting and quite difficult as I hadn't learnt about it yet. I got through most of the error exercises, but 1 left to go.

**Thoughts**: I like error handling in Rust, it seems concise with some nifty tricks to help get your end goal. A fair bit of learning around how to fully utilise the error handling, but good so far.
