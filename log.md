# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Rustlings course provided by the Rust team

**Thoughts:** It was OK, I managed to work through about 4 sections of the course today, but it was on topics I already knew fairly well. The later sections will be much harder I think!

### Day 2: March 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I started working on a timer/alarm project in Rust today. Took a break from the Rustlings course as I think I will need to read & take notes from 'The Book' before I can continue further.

**Thoughts**: It was pretty fun working through the different date & time crates. I was a bit disappointed with the crates available to play an MP3 player. They seem really heavy when all I want is to play an MP3 file. I'll put it down to my ignorance on how audio is processed.
