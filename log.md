# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Rustlings course provided by the Rust team

**Thoughts:** It was OK, I managed to work through about 4 sections of the course today, but it was on topics I already knew fairly well. The later sections will be much harder I think!

### Day 2: March 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I started working on a timer/alarm project in Rust today. Took a break from the Rustlings course as I think I will need to read & take notes from 'The Book' before I can continue further.

**Thoughts**: It was pretty fun working through the different date & time crates. I was a bit disappointed with the crates available to play an MP3 player. They seem really heavy when all I want is to play an MP3 file. I'll put it down to my ignorance on how audio is processed.

### Day 3: March 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on making the alarm program into an executable and then running it through the terminal on MacOS. Added in some additional lines to make it wait 15 minutes and ding. I want it to appear at the top/front of my screen when it ends, but don't know how to do that.

**Thoughts**: Today was one of those days where I don't feel like I achieved as much as I would have liked. It was a really valuable session today, I mean I didn't even know how to open an executable on MacOS until today, so that's good!

### Day 4: March 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Tackled the Rustlings course today and made my way through structs, modules, enums & collections.

**Thoughts**: I wasn't feeling it today so this was a struggle. A bit too tired to really throw myself fully at the alarm project especially as I know I need to deal with a Mac Window Manager of some sort.

### Day 5: March 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Error handling was pretty interesting and quite difficult as I hadn't learnt about it yet. I got through most of the error exercises, but 1 left to go.

**Thoughts**: I like error handling in Rust, it seems concise with some nifty tricks to help get your end goal. A fair bit of learning around how to fully utilise the error handling, but good so far.

### Day 6: March 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Hit a lot of brick walls and arguments with the compiler. Goal was to get user input and validate it, but ended up down a rabbit hole using ? and Result<i32, ParseIntError>. I couldn't get that to work too well, so defaulted back to match with Ok() & Err() arms. It works now, but the code itself is a mess and needs cleaning up.

**Thoughts**: It was a slog today and almost entirely all my fault. The compiler is an amazing tool and is pretty good at explaining the issue. Some of the issues could do with a bit more explanation and I should try to capture those & provide feedback. Maybe I could possibly help make the error reporting more verbose.

### Day 7: March 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the alarm project today with a focus on adding comments. Also added in some additional code to the sleeping function to make it functional. Intentionally made life a bit harder by including a requirement to 'safe cast' to u64 from u32. I could have just changed the value returned by a function to be u64.

**Thoughts**: I'm still enjoying it, but lacking creativity today with it. I also think that my code doesn't seem very idiomatic to Rust. I want to try and include some custom enums & structs in the project. Not sure what twist to add to it, I should create a menu of some sort to provide the user with more options. I could also try and find out what options there are to produce a GUI and not just a terminal. 
I feel like what has been achieved so far could be lifted easily into any other language - is that a good thing?

### Day 8: March 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created a new repo to cover off the work I do on Hackerrank. I am going to be focusing on Java & Python for the next few months (Sorry Rustlang :( ) as I need to prep for exams. I worked on Static blocks today, various Scan methods and Nodes

**Thoughts**: Moving back to Java is always a bit of a lurch. I find myself trying to code in Rust, but thankfully I find the 2 languages kind of similar so it's not the end of the world.

### Day 9: March 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Not a really good day for progress. I was able to complete 2 challenges on Hackerrank for Java, but it really wasn't a lot of fun doing so

**Thoughts**: I find myself getting frustrated with the way that the Java documentation is presented. It also feels like there are too many ways to achieve the same goal which doesn't help when trying to find the correct solution. Lesson being to always go for the implementation relevant to the latest Java version. I dislike the Java documentation greatly, but perhaps it's because I don't know how to read it. I feel like it is not the most user friendly when trying to understand how a class or method operates!

### Day 10: March 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 1/10 of the way through the challenge! A lot of work today on arrays with some data types thrown in.

**Thoughts**: I am still struggling to get my head around some of the wording of 'programming' problems. Initial reaction to them is that the problems always seem to sound much harder than they actually are. A lot of internal translation has to occur before I can start addressing the problem. 1/10 of the way through the challeenge after this. I am a bit annoyed as I feel like having to refocus on Java drags me way back in ability when compared to working with Rust. That's a mistruth though as I think the language right now is not the issue - Java just doesn't help as I find it quite unwieldy!

### Day 11: April 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Working through some more of the Hackerrank tasks today. Looked at Arrays in various forms a lot, 1D Arrays, 2D Arrays, using Arraylists etc. I was also working on implementing JUnit testing in the code and was able to make that work.

**Thoughts**: I still don't particularly enjoy Java, but need to just power through it for another 45 days.

### Day 12: April 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Working through some architectures and frameworks for software development today. Focus was primarily on Model View Controller and exploring cohesion & coupling. 

**Thoughts**: Interesting topics and I felt like I better understand why these constructs exist. I feel like I better appreciate why code is made modular and extensible now. Previous exposure to these topics was not comprehensive enough to cover them in the detail that has enabled me to understand it.

### Day 13: April 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: The work I did yesterday, as well as the Python coding I did via Devnet studies today pushed me into Classes & Interfaces. I created a Vehicle interface and a Car class that implements the Vehicle interface. Plan is to continue with a Bike class soon.

**Thoughts**: This was actually surprisingly fun and not too bad. Working through the code to create objects and provide the data to populate was cool. I am not too confident on HOW the class/interface relationship works, but I plan to read/watch around the subject. Pretty fun stuff really.
