# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Rustlings course provided by the Rust team

**Thoughts:** It was OK, I managed to work through about 4 sections of the course today, but it was on topics I already knew fairly well. The later sections will be much harder I think!
