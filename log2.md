# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 26: April 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Focusing on the mock exam papers for POP1 Python exam and the exercises for the course.

**Thoughts:** Worked through a lot of the exercises for POP1. The exercises have been quite basic so have worked through a number of the questions ~40. The questions have not been challenging which boosts confidence. I can actually see that I have progressed in my understanding of programming - not enough yet though!

### Day 27: April 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Further focus on the revision exercises

**Thoughts**: Not a fun one today, maybe I'm tired, but there were a lot of mistakes from me. I felt particularly perturbed as I found myself trying to use Java keywords and methods in Python.

### Day 28: April 19, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Further exam revision for Python. Primary focus today was on Matrices and Recursion.

**Thoughts**: I am still more wobbly on recursion than I'd like, but I think I am getting closer. Matrices had a lightbulb moment for me today. Usually I would get all flustered with matrices, but today I realised just treat them like their data structure. Matrix of lists? Just think of them all as lists, but needing a loop to access the desired list.

### Day 29: April 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Classes in Python

**Thoughts**: Took longer than I would like to devise a class for collating items similarly to a checkout. Some valuable lessons reinforced today which was useful, but need to tackle the Sector class next. I also would just like more work on Python classes in general.
