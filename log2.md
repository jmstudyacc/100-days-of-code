# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 26: April 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Focusing on the mock exam papers for POP1 Python exam and the exercises for the course.

**Thoughts:** Worked through a lot of the exercises for POP1. The exercises have been quite basic so have worked through a number of the questions ~40. The questions have not been challenging which boosts confidence. I can actually see that I have progressed in my understanding of programming - not enough yet though!

### Day 27: April 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Further focus on the revision exercises

**Thoughts**: Not a fun one today, maybe I'm tired, but there were a lot of mistakes from me. I felt particularly perturbed as I found myself trying to use Java keywords and methods in Python.

### Day 28: April 19, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Further exam revision for Python. Primary focus today was on Matrices and Recursion.

**Thoughts**: I am still more wobbly on recursion than I'd like, but I think I am getting closer. Matrices had a lightbulb moment for me today. Usually I would get all flustered with matrices, but today I realised just treat them like their data structure. Matrix of lists? Just think of them all as lists, but needing a loop to access the desired list.

### Day 29: April 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Classes in Python

**Thoughts**: Took longer than I would like to devise a class for collating items similarly to a checkout. Some valuable lessons reinforced today which was useful, but need to tackle the Sector class next. I also would just like more work on Python classes in general.

### Day 30: April 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finishing off the Classes exercises, they went into Inheritance and Data Structures in Python.

**Thoughts**: Inheritance really is a smart feature of a language. Great being able to write something once and reuse it. The data structures exercises were, as always, so much fun to get through. I am still a noob when it comes to them and could do with remembering what is req'd by that data structure, but I enjoy it a lot. I extended the Stack class to also print out the contents of the stack using a recursive function.

### Day 31: April 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with the Challenges for the Python coursework ahead of May exam. 

**Thoughts**:  The questions are much easier this time around which fills me with a lot of confidence. Tackling those tasks that were too hard before but now succeeding is a great feeling. I will continue to do these challenges until they are all complete and then possibly turn my attention back to Java. That is likely to happen before the exam, but need to balance the programming brain. I will likely get back on the Hackerrank and Java JetBrains Academy next week.

### Day 32: April 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished off the Challenge 3 exercises

**Thoughts**: The challenges were getting more difficult which was good. Testing a better breadth of skills and not just basic data type and control statements

### Day 33: April 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Working extra to cover the missed day yesterday - working on Hyperskill problems.

**Thoughts**: A lot of work on Strings today and using methods to return new copies of them.

### Day 34: April 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked through Mock exam papers ahead of the Python exam 06/05

**Thoughts**: It was not as tricky as I expected which bodes well. I am hopeful that come the real thing I will have the same feeling and be able to get through it without much issue. Variety of topics tests in the mock paper which always makes me worry that my achilles heel didn't come up! Although Matrices did and despite my new outlook on them I still dislike them!

### Day 35: April 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Multi-threading in Python stole my attention today

**Thoughts**: Working on learning about Python multi-threading today and how to achieve it. There are various ways to get to multi-threading, but seems like the best way is to use events? Fun stuff and something I would like to definitely learn more about.

### Day 36: April 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Further exam revision via PoP1 Mock Exams

**Thoughts**: Matrices are still a pain that I have not worked through. That along with the way the questions are worded makes decomposing the questions difficult. I dislike the presentation of the questions as a small paragraph of text does not lend itself well to answering. Frustrating but need to work with it.

### Day 37: April 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Working through the mock exams

**Thoughts**: The tasks were not that difficult although some of my implementations are ugly - lots of for loops for instance. However, they passed the test cases which is all I need to care about for the upcoming exam. I have worked through nearly every question in this mock paper, but there is still 1 more to go. I will need to take some time to look at it as the wording of the question throws me off.

### Day 38: April 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Working through some Hackerrank tasks for the Python track

**Thoughts**: Some of the tasks in the Hackerrank collection were not marked accurately for difficulty. They also lack tutorials on some of the problems which is a bit annoying. Frustrating as well that Python doesn't do arrays in the same way as Java, and some of the array magic can instead be achieved using Python dictionaries.

### Day 39: May 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Working on Hackerrank problems today with a focus on map() and any() built-ins

**Thoughts**: It was interesting to learn about more of the built-in functions of Python. A bit rusty on slicing Strings, but got through it, more slowly than I would have liked though.

### Day 40: May 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Working on a program that I can compile and give to my wife for her birthday May 03

**Thoughts**: I was using Rust again for this as I know it can be compiled and shared. I wanted to be able to provide her with a binary that can be run with minimal difficulty. It was hard moving back to Rust after using Java & Python, ESPECIALLY after using Python as the difference feels huge. I like what I came up with, but know that I could continue trying to improve it for the rest of the week - do not have that kind of time luxury! Too many sleep() calls in the program, but they achieve the desired goal but I would like to improve on that.

### Day 41: May 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Working on various sorting algorithms with a focus on Quicksort.

**Thoughts**: It was really interesting working on the different algorithms and implementing them in Python. A focus on Quicksort today with dual pivots and testing out how quickly it will sort the elements. A lot of fun today and helped to embed the steps of the algorithm - even if I forget I can also go back and look at my github!

### Day 42: May 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Spent my time today working on the mock exam papers ahead of the exam on Thursday

**Thoughts**: Although today was meant to not be about mocks/exams I took the chance to check my code against some of the mock exam model answers. My code didn't come up too badly when compared to the model answers! There are a few aspects I'm not happy with e.g. oveuse of range(len(x)) when dealing with a string and a simple for i in x: would acheive the same thing and demonstrate a better understanding of Python datatypes. I missed an entire question on 1 of the mock papers so ended up ploughing a lot of time into that. It is question8.py of the commit today. I was frustratingly close with my first attempt, but my second attempt of using a dictionary took me away. I came back to using indexing and got the solution needed, but that loose use of time won't be possible in the actual exam!

### Day 43: May 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Working through Hackerrank tasks on Strings and earlier worked on Data Structure theory

**Thoughts**: Keeping my mind sharp with Strings before exam tomorrow.
