# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 26: April 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Focusing on the mock exam papers for POP1 Python exam and the exercises for the course.

**Thoughts:** Worked through a lot of the exercises for POP1. The exercises have been quite basic so have worked through a number of the questions ~40. The questions have not been challenging which boosts confidence. I can actually see that I have progressed in my understanding of programming - not enough yet though!
