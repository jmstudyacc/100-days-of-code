# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 51: May 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: More work on Concurrency Utilities in Java. Wrapping up the section on Semaphores and moving on to CountDownLatches

**Thoughts:** Pretty interesting seeing how the different synchronization methods work. Enjoyed playing around with the Semaphores to effectively break the program or change the order of the program. Bears remembering that these are just synchronization tools. You can make the thread do whatever you want when the permit is provided!
