# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 51: May 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: More work on Concurrency Utilities in Java. Wrapping up the section on Semaphores and moving on to CountDownLatches

**Thoughts:** Pretty interesting seeing how the different synchronization methods work. Enjoyed playing around with the Semaphores to effectively break the program or change the order of the program. Bears remembering that these are just synchronization tools. You can make the thread do whatever you want when the permit is provided!

### Day 52: May 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Sharpening skills again on Hackerrank ahead of Wednesday exam

**Thoughts**: Not a great session today, pretty tired and struggled to really get to grips with the work. Some work on Hackerrank and looked into the BigDecimal problem that was lingering. Don't fully understand the solution so some debugging needed to see it in action.

### Day 53: May 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Working through the Mock exam for the PoP2 Java exam on Wednesday

**Thoughts**: It was really easy. Too easy if the PoP1 exam is anything to measure against. I will continue with the 2019 and 2020 exam papers as I aleady know they are more difficult. Biggest concerns for me right now? A coherent approach to constructing classes probably and my arch-nemesis Matrices.
