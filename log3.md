# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 51: May 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: More work on Concurrency Utilities in Java. Wrapping up the section on Semaphores and moving on to CountDownLatches

**Thoughts:** Pretty interesting seeing how the different synchronization methods work. Enjoyed playing around with the Semaphores to effectively break the program or change the order of the program. Bears remembering that these are just synchronization tools. You can make the thread do whatever you want when the permit is provided!

### Day 52: May 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Sharpening skills again on Hackerrank ahead of Wednesday exam

**Thoughts**: Not a great session today, pretty tired and struggled to really get to grips with the work. Some work on Hackerrank and looked into the BigDecimal problem that was lingering. Don't fully understand the solution so some debugging needed to see it in action.

### Day 53: May 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Working through the Mock exam for the PoP2 Java exam on Wednesday

**Thoughts**: It was really easy. Too easy if the PoP1 exam is anything to measure against. I will continue with the 2019 and 2020 exam papers as I aleady know they are more difficult. Biggest concerns for me right now? A coherent approach to constructing classes probably and my arch-nemesis Matrices.

### Day 54: May 17, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Jun 2019 mock exam

**Thoughts**: On the whole I think it was a positive experience, there was one problem that I really struggled with and that was using HashMaps in a way to store days values and the values of those days. Mental gymnastics for me to get through that even with the solutions provided - took plenty of notes on it and tried to understand it better. The rest of the exam was easier to wrap my head around. The same can be more or less said for the 2020 exam paper, but the difficulty could vary so wildly!

### Day 55: May 18, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Worked through lambda expressions to have some understanding of them

**Thoughts**: Lambda expressions are pretty powerful and feel somewhat similar to Match statements that I've come across before in Rust. The work on Lambdas has helped improve my understanding of where they appear somewhat in Rust. It was a pretty cool session today, see how you can take an expression and reverse strings, toggle cases and replace chracters.

### Day 56: May 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Java exam today and did some studying up on Iterators() in Java

**Thoughts**: Bliss, finally finished with my obligation to learn Java. That may change if I pass my core exams and go back for the 2nd year. However, at present I am going to forget about it as I've never really been a fan. Looked at Iterators() today as deleting from an arraylist is a damn nightmare and more Lambda expression studies.

### Day 57: May 22, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Working on Unity Game Development

**Thoughts**: Well, my streak was officially broken! Not that I care, I'm just going to carry on with the challenge as usual. I have been spending a few days on trying to play with Unity to make some games. I don't yet know how to upload games properly to Unity but once I do I'll provide a link!
